## Thanks to:
[dbt-spark-livy ](https://github.com/cloudera/dbt-spark-livy)

Most of the code it theirs (or dbt-spark). I only converted it to use the Azure 
Synapse Library. The only actually change is in connections and synapse_spark.

## Warning:
**This is in an experimental phase. A lot of testing still has to be done.**

Also, this library relies on the Microsoft library for connecting to Azure
Synapse which is in preview.
